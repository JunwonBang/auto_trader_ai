duration
    not really relative, so '1m' is the best option

# of data
    20250401-20250501 -> about 45000 data
    20250301-20250501 -> about 90000 data
    
trainig steps
    100k might be the best(experimental)

data preprocessing

algorithm(sup learning + unsup learning + rl(step func) + rule based)
